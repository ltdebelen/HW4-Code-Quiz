# HW4-Code-Quiz

## Description
An interactive timer-based quiz application that tests user's knowledge on web development topics and concepts.

Play proceeds as follow:

* The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

* Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

* Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

* When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.

## Other Criteria/Features
* Application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
